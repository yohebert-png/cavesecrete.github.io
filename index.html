        <h2>About Cave Secrète</h2>

        <p>
          I grew up in Burgundy, not far from Chablis, and I’ve always mostly drunk French wine.
          I keep a private cellar in Burgundy with more than 400 bottles, and over the last ten years
          I have purchased more than 300 bottles of French wine in Australia.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since moving to Australia, I’ve seen how difficult it can be to find good French wine at a fair price.
          Bottle shop prices are often double or triple what you’d pay in France, and many importers tend to bring wines
          that match Australian tastes — more fruit-forward, riper, bigger styles — rather than classic French profiles.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I first arrived, I didn’t know anything about Australian wine (I still don’t), so I would go to a bottle shop,
          pick a random bottle, and often end up disappointed. I realised this is probably what happens to Australians trying
          to pick a French bottle for the first time: confusing labels, inconsistent quality, and often overpriced.
        </p>

        <p>
          Cave Secrète is my way of making French wine a little easier for a small group of families and friends.
          The principles are simple:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Only French wine.</li>
          <li>Only bottles I would buy for myself.</li>
          <li>Only when the price is reasonable compared with France.</li>
          <li>Only cost + 10% sourcing fee. I don’t make money from this — if someone buys ten bottles, I buy myself a nice bottle as my reward.</li>
          <li>Only for a small, private group — I can’t source large quantities.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Everyone’s taste is different. The goal isn’t to tell people what they should like, but to give them the chance
          to explore good French wine without the usual bottle-shop mark-ups.
