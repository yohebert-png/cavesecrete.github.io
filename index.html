        <h1>Cave Secrète</h1>
        <h2 class="subtitle">Private French Wine Club</h2>
        <p>
          Cave Secrète is a private French wine club for a small circle of families in Australia, focused on authentic French wines sourced at fair prices.
        </p>
        <p>
          I grew up in Burgundy, near Chablis, where wine is part of everyday life. Since moving to Australia, I’ve seen how difficult it can be to find good French wine at a fair price. Bottle shop prices are often 50–100% higher than in France, and the quality can be inconsistent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cave Secrète exists to quietly bridge that gap. Every bottle is sourced as if I were buying it for my own cellar, and offered at <strong>cost + a 10% sourcing fee</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Selections change depending on what I find at auction and through trusted suppliers. Membership remains intentionally small to keep the club personal, discreet, and genuinely useful.

      <div class="section-inner">
        <h2>Current Selection</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          All wines offered here come directly from France, sourced through auctions and trusted suppliers in Australia. I only buy bottles that represent genuine value compared to French retail prices, and only wines I would happily put in my own cellar.
        </p>
        <p class="section-intro">
          Typical price range: <strong>$40–$80</strong>, with occasional special bottles when an exceptional opportunity appears at auction.

            <p class="wine-notes">
              Silky, structured Bordeaux with dark fruit, fine tannins, and long finish. Excellent value at a price close to what it sells for in France.

        <h2>About Cave Secrète</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Yoann. I was born and raised in Burgundy, not far from Chablis. Wine has always been part of everyday life &mdash; from family meals to visits with local winemakers.
        </p>
        <p>
          I keep a private cellar in Burgundy with more than 400 bottles, and over the last ten years I have purchased more than 500 bottles at auction in Australia. I mostly drink French wine, and I know how it feels to stand in front of a shelf here, pick a bottle at random, and end up disappointed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many people in Australia face the same problem when buying French wine: high prices, confusing labels, and no guarantee that the wine will suit their taste.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cave Secrète is my way of making French wine a little easier for a small group of families and friends. The principles are simple:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Only French wine.</li>
          <li>Only bottles I would buy for myself.</li>
          <li>Only when the price is reasonable compared to France.</li>
          <li>Only cost + 10% sourcing fee.</li>
          <li>Only for a small, private group.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Everyone’s taste is different. The goal is not to tell people what they should like, but to give them the chance to explore good French wine without bottle-shop mark-ups.
