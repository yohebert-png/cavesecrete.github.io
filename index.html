        <p>
          Cave Secrète is a small, invitation-only wine club dedicated to sharing authentic French wine
          at fair prices with a close circle of families and friends in Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every bottle is sourced as if I were choosing it for my own cellar. Prices are always
          <strong>cost + 10% sourcing fee</strong> — nothing more.

        <h2>About Cave Secrète</h2>

        <p>
          I grew up in Burgundy, not far from Chablis, and I’ve always mostly drunk French wine.
          I keep a private cellar in Burgundy with more than 400 bottles, and over the last ten years
          I’ve purchased more than 300 bottles of French wine in Australia.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since moving here, I’ve realised how hard it can be to find good French wine at a fair price.
          Bottle shops often charge double or triple the cost in France, and many importers focus on wines
          tailored to Australian tastes — bigger, riper, and more fruit-driven — rather than classic French styles.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I first arrived, I didn’t know anything about Australian wine (I still don’t).
          I would pick bottles at random and often end up disappointed. I realised that Australians must feel
          exactly the same when trying to choose a French bottle for the first time — unfamiliar labels,
          inconsistent styles, and very high prices.
        </p>

        <p>
          Cave Secrète is my way of making French wine a little easier and more accessible for a small group of
          families and friends. The principles are simple:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Only French wine.</li>
          <li>Only bottles I would buy for myself.</li>
          <li>Only when the price is reasonable compared to France.</li>
          <li>Only cost + 10% sourcing fee.</li>
          <li>Only small quantities — this is not a commercial operation.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Everyone’s taste is different. The goal isn’t to tell people what they should like, but to give
          them the opportunity to explore quality French wine without bottle-shop mark-ups.
