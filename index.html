            If you're not sure what to choose, I can curate a selection for you — 
            just tell me how many bottles you’d like or give me a budget.  
            If you’re looking for something specific (champagne, older vintages, 
            large formats, or a special-occasion bottle), send me a message and 
            I’ll try to find it.

        <h2>About Cave Secrète</h2>

        <p>
          I grew up in Burgundy, not far from Chablis, and I’ve always mostly drunk French wine.
          I keep a private cellar in Burgundy with more than 400 bottles, and over the last ten years
          I have purchased more than 300 bottles of French wine in Australia.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since moving to Australia, I’ve seen how difficult it can be to find good French wine at a fair price.
          Bottle shop prices are often double or triple what you’d pay in France, and many importers focus on wines
          that fit the Australian palate — riper, bigger, more fruit-forward — rather than classic French styles.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I first arrived, I didn’t know anything about Australian wine (I still don’t), so I would go to a
          bottle shop, pick a random bottle, and often end up disappointed. I realised this is probably what happens
          to Australians trying to choose a French bottle: confusing labels, inconsistent quality, and overpriced options.
        </p>

        <p>
          Cave Secrète is simply my way of introducing good French wine to friends.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Only French wine.</li>
          <li>Only bottles I would buy for myself.</li>
          <li>Only when the price is reasonable compared to France.</li>
          <li>Only cost + 10% sourcing fee so I can buy a nice bottle for myself as a reward !</li>
          <li>Only for a small, private group.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The goal is not to tell people what they should like, just to help them explore good French wine.
